<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Rent Helper Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/ryanbender2/rent-helper-myfirstproject)

<strong>Hello there.</strong>
<p>However you got here, thanks for being here, I'm glad to have you. What you're looking at here is my first ever project. Complete with no project structure, a misunderstanding of technologies, and a whole lot of enthusiasm to learn about programming.
In the summer of 2019, I found myself working as a cyber security intern a small business. At the time, I didn't really have any interest in programming, I knew of it, but barely. I was interested in hacking, but with that came the necessity of learning how to code. A mentor of mine at school told me over a dinner, "If you want to be a hacker, you have to learn to code. There's no way around it." I didn't really know what to make of it at the time, but I figured...alright, I guess I'll need to learn that at some point. This didn't mean anything to me at my internship until I was given a small 'coding' project.</p>
<p>I was tasked to rewrite a MatLab script in Python. How? How was I supposed to do that? I sure didn't know, but I was going to figure it out. Over the course of learning Python for that task I would come to find a love for code. My co-worker probably had no idea he would literally shape my career path by that simple task. 
I did it. I completed the task. Somehow. I was filled with excitement and accomplishment. It was bad, don't get me wrong, but it was there, and it had just placed a spark of enthusiasm for coding in me.</p>
<p>I wanted to code now. Something, anything. At the time, I had just moved in with my new roommates. Somewhat arbitrarily, I took on the responsibility of paying our bills, power, water, rent, etc. After a couple months of trying to manage it, I was starting to get really annoyed by having to keep track of everything. This is what gave my inspiration for this project.</p>
<p>I remember I was sitting at my desk at work. I had finished everything I needed to do that day and was trying to find something to do. Then it hit me. The idea, the lightbuld, for this project. A wave of excitement washed over me like I had just found my true love. I'll skip past all the details, but over the next coming weeks, I would poor every bit of smarts I had in me to build this project. It wasn't pretty. It was also wrought with copied code (Stack Overflow to the rescue). But it was mine. I had created my first project.</p>
<p>I remembered what my mentor had said at school. It rang different now. He said coding skill was essential for a hacker. But all I wanted to do was code now. Hacking was but a side project now. A means to get me to what I really wanted to do, at best. "Is it possible to just code for a job?" I asked this not knowing the answer. I thought to myself, there's no way anyone codes for a living. It is too much fun. In my mind, coding was the icing on top, the "fun" stuff. But you couldn't just do it for a living, surely. Otherwise, why would anyone do anything else?</p>
<p>I found out software developers were in high demand. I forgot about pen testing. I got a software developer job right out of college.</p>

_The rest is history._
